# Java OO Stey By Step 

## Business Requirement
- Due to the requirement for diff steps of practice which in README.md of test folder, Please write the corresponding implementation code in src folder to pass tests and fulfill the requirement.

or
gradle test (if you have Gradle installed in local machine)
```

* Due to the requirement in src/test/java/paractice_*/README.md, Complete the corrsponding code in src/main/java/practice_*/。Test must be passed, requirement must be fulfilled.
